# NeighbourCheck
**NOTE: STILL WIP**

____________________________________________________________________


Using arrays to check neighbour elements and count this.


Essentially, the code will allow the checking of neighbour elements via user input. If the user wants to check the 1st row only, the code will then count the number of neighbours surrounding it. 


1 row should be 8 neighbours, (+ 8)

2 rows should be 24 neighbours, (+ 16)

3 rows should be 48 neighbours, (+ 24)

...

n rows should be x neighbours, (OR x-1+ 8n)
